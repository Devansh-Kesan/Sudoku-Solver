# Sudoku Solver using Pycosat

This is a Sudoku solver implemented in Python using the `pycosat` library.

## Requirements

- Python 
- Pycosat library

## How to Run

1. Ensure that you have the required software installed. You can install Pycosat with pip:

pip install pycosat


2. Each line of the file 'p.txt' should represent a Sudoku puzzle, with each cell represented by a digit (1-9) or a period (.) for empty cells.

3. Run the Python script:

python lab4.py


## How It Works

The script reads Sudoku puzzles from 'p.txt', and for each puzzle, it generates a list of constraints that represent the rules of Sudoku. These constraints are then passed to `pycosat.solve()`, which finds a solution that satisfies all the constraints. The solution is then processed and printed out. The time taken to solve all puzzles is also printed at the end.

## output

The output.txt file contains the output of given sodoku's. You will be able to see complete output only after complete py file gets executed

## Note

The size of the Sudoku grid (n) is determined by the user's input at runtime. The grid size must be a perfect square (e.g., 4, 9, 16) due to the rules of Sudoku.
